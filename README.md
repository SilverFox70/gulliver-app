## Gulliver
#### Create and share stories using interactive maps.

Geography and distance is a large part of what forms our opinions, shifts our narratives, and fundamentally molds our personalities. Where you are born changes your entire world perspective, and where you go from there is just as important.

Gulliver is an interactive storytelling application where users can tell stories based on their locations. Each 'chapter' of their story is a point on a map.

### Planning / UX

Below are a few wireframes that map out (pun intended) the overall user interface.

#### Wireframes

While these are the original wireframes I created in Balsamiq, there are some changes I made for the MVP due to time restraints.  Currently, there are no comments or likes. Also, the view of the map is different from how I eventually want to create it.
